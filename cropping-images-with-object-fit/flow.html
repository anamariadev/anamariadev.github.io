            <h2>A Time for Resilience</h2>

            <p>The theme of this year’s report is RESILIENCE and within these pages you will have the opportunity to see just how resilient our faculty, staff, students, and alumni have been over the last 20 months. The past year and a half has been an amazing time for TAMIU. Our faculty and staff’s dedication to our students and to ensure that they had and continue to have the best possible educational experience has been truly inspiring. The story of this University is steeped in resilience. It is a story of continued growth and increased access to higher education for the people of Webb County and South Texas. Our mission is driven by academic excellence, innovative scholarship, and student success. These three pillars undergird our foundation, permeate everything we do, and champion the IMPACT we have on this community, the region, and the State of Texas. Dedication to our mission and the people of South Texas has led to a consistently high ranking among regional Universities in the West in US News and World Report and by many other ranking organizations.</p>

            <p>We are developers of human capital and an economic engine for Laredo and the region. We continue to be recognized nationally as an institution with a student debt that is among the lowest in the nation, for the upward mobility of our graduates, and the value of our degrees as measured by Return on Investment (ROI). Our undergraduate and graduate programs regularly receive regional and national recognition. </p>

            <p>I would like to briefly recap some of TAMIU’s accomplishments over the past 20 months.</p>

            <p>We had one of the most successful legislative sessions in my 13 years at TAMIU, thanks to our legislative delegation, Senator Judith Zaffirini and Representatives Richard Peña Raymond and Tracy King. Because of our enrollment growth, we received an additional $3.8M over the biennium, which enabled us to create multiple new faculty positions for the first time in over 10 years. These new positions will lead to strengthening existing programs and allow us to add new programs. </p>

            <p>In addition, we received $6M over the biennium for our Path to Academic and Student Success (PASS) program which focuses on improving graduation and persistence rates, and targets junior and senior students. We also received an appropriation to construct a new Health Sciences Education and Research building. This facility will allow us to increase our health-related research and community outreach, something that’s a legacy for us.</p>

            <p>The McKenzie Scott $40M gift has led to new opportunities for this University. In addition to doubling our Endowment, this gift inspired two donors to create endowed professorships in Engineering. These are the first of what I hope are many endowed professorships and chairs at TAMIU. We continue looking for other opportunities to match and thus expand her gift.</p>

            <p>We added new Bachelor’s degrees in Public Health, Petroleum Engineering and Computer Engineering and a Ph.D. program in Criminal Justice (CJ). The Ph.D. in CJ is our second free-standing doctoral program.</p>

            <p>In closing, TAMIU continues to provide high quality higher education access to the citizens of Laredo and the region. We contribute to the economic well-being of Laredo and our graduates are successful once they leave.</p>

            <p>Because we constantly GO BEYOND in everything we do, we have been very fortunate to receive numerous regional and national recognitions for our successes, our entrepreneurship, our scholarship, and our commitment to students, our community, and State.</p>

            <p>I am very proud of what we have done, as I hope are you, our alumni, and friends. As you will see in these pages, we are resilient and will continue to be!</p>

            <p>After all, it’s how we Go Beyond.</p>

            <p>Dr. Pablo Arenaz<br />TAMIU President</p>
