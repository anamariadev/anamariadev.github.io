    <p>A Texas A&M International University (TAMIU) faculty member has been named one of three individual statewide recipients of the Chancellor’s Academy of Teacher Educators (CATE) Award presented by Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp.</p>

    <p>Dr. Lola Norris, associate professor of Spanish and Translation in the College of Arts & Sciences, was presented the Award during the recent Chancellor’s Century Council Annual Meeting in College Station.  The Academy acknowledges teaching excellence and is supported by the Chancellor’s Century Council, a group committed to advancing the future of higher education in Texas.</p>

    <p>Recipients of the distinguished CATE Award receive a specially designed commemorative medallion bearing the seal of the A&M System, a Certificate, and a stipend.</p>

    <p>TAMIU Regents professor, provost, and vice president for Academic Affairs, Dr. Tom Mitchell, shared insight on Dr. Norris’ nomination.</p>

    <p>“Dr. Norris was nominated by her dean, Dr. Claudia San Miguel.  Dr. Norris has been the leader of our Spanish faculty in the preparation of future teachers.  She has dedicated years to working with our College of Education faculty to create a Spanish placement process and curriculum that meets student needs.   In addition to being a constructive leader in program design and a model of inter-collegiate cooperation, she has been an outstanding teacher for the program, teaching both advanced Spanish courses required of Bilingual Education majors, “ Dr. Mitchell said.</p>

    <p>TAMIU president Dr. Pablo Arenaz concurred and noted Norris’ additional TAMIU service and research.</p>

    <p>“Dr. Norris is a model faculty member and recognized by her peers who elected her Faculty Senate President for two consecutive years, the last including the challenge of the COVID-19 Pandemic.  She has most recently been recognized with the Senator Judith Zaffirini Faculty Award for Scholarship and Leadership and maintains an impressive research profile. Her book, “General Alonso de León’s Expeditions into Texas, 1686-1690,” has been published by the Texas A&M University Press,” Dr. Arenaz noted.</p>

    <p>Norris earned TAMIU’s first Master of Arts in Spanish in 1999 and was also the first doctoral graduate from TAMIU in the collaborative Ph.D. program in Hispanic Studies with Texas A&M University.</p>

    <p>The two other CATE Award recipients were Dr. Robin D. Johnson. Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, and Dr. Steven B. Chumbley, Texas A&M University-Kingsville. Team Award recipients were also named.</p>
